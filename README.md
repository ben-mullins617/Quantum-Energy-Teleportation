# Previous Methods of Quantum Teleportation

<!-- define teleportation -->
"Teleportation" is the hypothetical transfer of a quantity from one point in space to another without traversing the space in between. 
<!-- outline previous methods of teleportation -->
Methods of teleportation for certain quantities are already well established in the quantum mechanical realm, such as for information and computation. 

## Quantum Information Teleportation

<!-- overview -->
Quantum Information Teleportation (QIT) is a protocol that utilizes Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) to teleport the quantum state of a qubit from one party to another. 
<!-- describe QIT algorithm -->
Let there be two parties Alice and Bob (A and B), and let A have a quantum state that she wants to securely communicate to B.
A and B first share two uniformly entangled qubits (an "EPR pair"). This is either given from one to the other, or distributed by a trusted third party. 
A performs an operation between the qubit whose state she wants to share and her EPR qubit, and (as an application of LOCC) measures her qubits and sends said measurements to B.
B then performs one of two operations based on which measurement he recieved, and the result is an exact "copy" of Alice's original state now in Bob's possession.
This doesn't violate the no-cloning theorem because in order for this to happen, the original state first has to be measured, and therefore destroyed.
This essentially means that the state has been "transferred" rather than "copied", and due to the nature of the EPR qubits, this tranfer is non-local, making it the "teleportation" of a quantum state (which contains extractable information).
